# ***About_Me***

>  Dhominick Here!, nothing much but hoping to reach a reality that has the same aspiration as I dreamed and hope it to be. Currently, working on catching up with my lessons and improving my artistic skills. Hope I can find some interesting projects to work on. Catch me up with my personal blog: s̸̳̩̰͉̽̑̉͆̎͂̎̕͜ȳ̶̻̥̩̟̰̠̬͝ș̶͍͒͒͜t̷̜̪͈̱̯͖̋͒̔͒̍͑ŗ̴̢͖͖̼͕̭̥̞̤̿͆͑i̷̢̼̻̖̜̾͐̑̋̔̈̈̈́̐̑ͅȁ̶̦̠̉͌̀̋̔͝.̶̡̢̩͕̳̹͗͘͝ś̴̛̱̪̲̹̼̹̬̐̈̏̾͗̓͗̋ͅẙ̴͔̖̟͖̞̣͋ͅẗ̶͇́̈́̏̎̀e̷̞͇͔̩͔̫̳͊̾̿̈̄̎̍̕͜s̴̨̻̩̠͇̩̈́.̷̨͙̯̻̥̥͊́̏͛̎̽̚̕̕n̷̔ͅe̸̘̣̜̣̙̣̋̽̿͜͠t̸̡̼̬̰̲͖̼̣̯͕̾́̕͝.
